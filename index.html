        <h3>Resist the Temptation</h3>
        <p class="lirycs">
            Resist the temptation of the beast<br>
            You'll slip and lose your grip and forever fall asleep<br>
            The venom is contagious, beware of its spell<br>
            What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell<br><br>
            I wonder if she knows the devil's taken off her clothes<br>
            Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control<br>
            Poppas doing worse, a victim of the deadly curse<br>
            Wouldn't be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse and oh, how it hurts<br><br>
            The children pay the biggest price<br>
            Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life<br>
            Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap<br>
            Someone's at the top supplying us with much crack<br><br>
